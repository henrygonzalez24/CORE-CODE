# LOGIC PROBLEM
## NOVEMBER 28TH 

The teacher asks his 5 students if they studied mathematics yesterday.

Alice: "Nobody studied math yesterday".
Bob: "1 person studied math yesterday".
Charlie: "2 people studied math yesterday".
Dan: "3 people studied mathematics yesterday".
Eva: "4 people studied mathematics yesterday".

The teacher knows that only those who studied would be telling the truth and those who didn't would be lying. Who is telling the truth?

### SOLUTION

```
Bob is telling the truth, because he can say that he study math yesterday without know if the rest of the people study or not.
