# LOGIC PROBLEM
## NOVEMBER 28TH 

The teacher asks his 5 students if they studied mathematics yesterday.

Alice: "Nobody studied math yesterday".
Bob: "1 person studied math yesterday".
Charlie: "2 people studied math yesterday".
Dan: "3 people studied mathematics yesterday".
Eva: "4 people studied mathematics yesterday".

The teacher knows that only those who studied would be telling the truth and those who didn't would be lying. Who is telling the truth?

### SOLUTION

```
Bob is telling the truth, because he can say that he study math yesterday without know if the rest of the people study or not.

# CEREAL OR MILK

Create an algorithm to prepare a bowl of cereal with milk. Represent the result in pseudocode and in a flowchart.

1. Grab a bowl
2. Add cereal
3. Ask if wants something more:
  3.1 add fruit (banana/strawberries) 
  3.2 Add granola
4. Add milk
5. Enjoy

# PRINT MY NAME

The pseudocode of the algorithm is the following:

-Algorithm: myname
   - Imprimir 'Henry González'
-Algorithm end

# PRINT MY NAME & AGE

The pseudocode of the algorithm is the following:

-Algorithm: myname
    -Imprimir 'Henry González'
   - Imprimir '24'
-Algorithm end

# MOD

The challenge for you now is to create a PSeInt program that will receive a number from the user and add the mod operator using the even/odd case ( X % 2 ) where X is the user input

        Leer X
        Imprimir X % 2
