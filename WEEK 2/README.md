# LOGIC PROBLEM
## NOVEMBER 28TH 

The teacher asks his 5 students if they studied mathematics yesterday.

Alice: "Nobody studied math yesterday".
Bob: "1 person studied math yesterday".
Charlie: "2 people studied math yesterday".
Dan: "3 people studied mathematics yesterday".
Eva: "4 people studied mathematics yesterday".

The teacher knows that only those who studied would be telling the truth and those who didn't would be lying. Who is telling the truth?

### SOLUTION

```
Bob is telling the truth, because he can say that he study math yesterday without know if the rest of the people study or not.

# CEREAL OR MILK

Create an algorithm to prepare a bowl of cereal with milk. Represent the result in pseudocode and in a flowchart.

1. Grab a bowl
2. Add cereal
3. Ask if wants something more:
  3.1 add fruit (banana/strawberries) 
  3.2 Add granola
4. Add milk
5. Enjoy

# TRUTH TABLES 

## DECEMBER 1ST

You are going to learn about three main logical operations used in programming, these operations are called AND, OR, and NOT. Each of the operations uses booleans as operands, and when applying the operations a result is generated, which is also a boolean, this is easier to check using the Truth Tables for each of the operations, now your task is for you to learn, and add the Truth Tables for each of the operations add them to your README and check if the following operations are correct by answering ✅ or ❌ at the end of each operation

|Operation | Answer|
|----------|-------|
| T `&` T = T | ✅ |
| T `&` F = F | ✅ |
| F `&` T = T | ❌ |
| F `&` F = F | ✅ |
| T `OR` T = T | ✅ |
| T `OR` F = F | ❌ |
| F `OR` T = T | ✅ |
| F `OR` F = F | ✅ |
| `~`T = T | ❌ |
| `~`F = T | ✅ |
| (T `&` F) `OR` (`~`F) = T | ✅ |
| (T `OR` F ) `&` (F `OR` F) = T | ❌ |
| `~`((T `OR` F ) `&` (F `OR` F)) `&` F = T | ❌ |
| `~`((T `OR` F ) `&` (F `OR` F)) `&` T = F | ❌ |
